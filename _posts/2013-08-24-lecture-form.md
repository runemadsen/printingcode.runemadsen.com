Format and Form
===============

<blockquote >
	Design is relationships. That is where you start. - Paul Rand
</blockquote>

On the most basic level, graphic design is about creating meaning from shapes. These shapes can be anything from the simplest geometrical shapes, to complex shapes holding a lot meaning – like letters.

Creating a functional design often entails working with these shapes to establish a good relationship between the content you're trying to design, and the form you're trying to present it in. Understanding the different techniques you can use to create a succesful relationship is therefore crucial.

So this is where we will begin our journey: By looking at simple words as content, simple black and white shapes as the form, and try to create succesful relationships between them using different rules of composition.

Let's say - as an exercise - that we want to create another design for the word. Something that is a little more fitting.

There's really no way of saying what the "correct" design is, but we can talk about why you would choose a specific design over another. To be able to choose, you need to take a range of things into account, and that's what makes a really good designer: Choosing the best form for a specific piece of content.

For example, one could argue that setting the word in a green Comic Sans font is not the best way of supporting the content. It's a happy look, both in color and in typographic shape.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/danger2-a6b745964c941530f04f8e562f5cd200.png"  />

One could instead argue that a bolder font that alerts the eye and therefore underpins the importance of the message is a better fit. On top of that you could choose - say - the color red, with its cultural significance (it's used in signage, blood, etc), as a much better way of conveying the message.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/danger3-a99ae9409216bd9d2dee812eda169b1b.png"  />

This is really what design is about: Even on the most basic level, choosing the correct forms for your message.


An Ice Cream Cone
-----------------

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/cones-71ab6a80703b6d94de028c5f07858081.jpg"  />

This is an ice cream cone. Ask any person in the world who has at one time seen an ice cream cone, and there's a good chance they will agree. While it looks like an ice cream cone, it's also just a black triangle and half of an ellipse on a white background.

The other is an almost identical image that uses the exact same shapes, in the same sizes, on a white background. However, it looks a lot less like an ice cream cone, and I bet you a majority of people would agree if asked.

For such an obvious example, there's a few important lessons for everyone who want to learn about design:

* Seeing and analyzing the things we see comes natural to us humans. There is nothing specifically artistic about determining why the above image resembles an ice cream cone, and still this is the only skill required to learn design. Learning design is just an extension of something that we all do every day: Seeing and thinking.

* Even though we often think of the visual arts as being a somewhat subjective field, the fundamentals of graphic design are not. Most of the rules taught in this book are very objective, and we have the ability to discuss whether a specific piece of work is successful or not.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/luisacone-81f472d85b3362e8b5d153d202dffec4.jpg"  />

However, there's a slight curl on the tail of this statement. That is, the way you will end up using the design rules can both be artistic and subjective. In this case it's much harder to say which image a majority of people would prefer. We can all agree that they in some way solve the job of drawing an ice cream cone, but they use drastically different techniques to do so.

When it comes to today's assignment: Make sure you learn the basics before you add the spice.


Basic Relationships
-------------------

This week I will like you to think about only 5 relationships. They are:

<ul >
	<li><strong>Format</strong> - How big is my canvas?</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> - Rectangle? Triangle? Ellipse?</li>
	<li><strong>Position</strong> - Where do we place it?</li>
	<li><strong>Dimension</strong> - What size should it have?</li>
	<li><strong>Rotation</strong> - Do I turn it?</li>
</ul>

With these 5 relationships, we can build a multitude of things, and start to play with symbolism.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/scared-6dd870dc590cc2b9f5d2f90c4fa4fd12.jpg"  />

Format
------

All designs starts with a constrained area - let's call it the _format_. The format dictates the way we understand the forms in it.

The rectangular format makes no attempt to emphasize any direction. It concentrates the viewport into a well-known shape, and makes it easy to understand the placement of the elements inside of it.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/format_square-fb0cf594632f5fb6f2c70bd6bd7e4389.jpg"  />
	
The horizontal format is very natural, shaped to the way we experience the world. The human brain is optimized for analyzing horizontal movement (that orange thing moving behind the trees is probably a tiger!) in opposed to vertical movement.
	
<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/format_horizontal-9fbd530a63a6da001195661e1b859e8b.jpg"  />
	
The vertical format stands out and calls attention to itself. It's more aggressive and seems more "designed", which is probably why most posters have a vertical format.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/format_vertical-915ded32f14c7ae27cd1170e25506c3e.jpg"  />

Even a simple thing like choosing the bounds of your design matters.


Shape
-----

When we have the format in place we can draw stuff in it. Using color differences, we can create anything from simple to very complicated shapes.

You all know the simple drawing functions in Processing: rect(), ellipse() and triangle().

The rectangle is very solid and recognizable.
	
<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/rect-3a98672d7a9ed8e98805bb870a7689c5.jpg"  />
	
The circle is smooth, and appears smaller than the rectangle, even though they have equal dimensions.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/circle-18e261c5e1f54f23b2dd56c905d05e0d.jpg"  />

The triangle is one of the simplest polygons possible, but it has a lot more movement than the square and the circle.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/triangle-0e0fcdb6aba85b6de24ff226d3600273.jpg"  />
	
With these simple shapes we already have a range of expressions, and you need to chose them wisely as they all have a distinct style.

Here a rectangle is used to convey technology, on a carton box for a dictating machine.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/packaging_square-14fc7e549c51eaf226f5251d1fa64f9d.jpg"  />

The circle is not a native shape of the cheese, but chosen to convey smoothness and round taste.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/packaging_circle-3f5076e1ced7281c4186e6d50e141541.jpg"  />

A triangle is used to create a sense of sharpness for a knife product.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/packaging_triangle-74dba9fa97775d794daa89101c0e8e5d.jpg"  />

As Paul Rand said in today's text: Everything is Design!

Design is a journey from complexity to simplicity, and as you experienced in this week's assignment, constraining yourself to three simpe shapes can still give a million different outcomes.

Here are some examples of how you can use these basic shapes in graphic design. Here it's Josef Muller-Brockmann:

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/brockmann_arcs-f15ca9a226045cad8cf5cbb7821af54b.jpg"  />

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/brockmann_rects-71690b4e15cb59f820ba303b7caa1059.jpg"  />

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/brockmann_circles-665257392d87433496afce8e6a268815.jpg"  />

Here are some newer examples from Conrad Smith.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/conrad1-91d67ab2649ee2d11247433cfc2276de.jpg"  />

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/conrad2-2cf7b45954a90d36ea49a9b9e2523aaa.jpg"  />

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/conrad3-9081df5b353fe14cafa4d4c5c4c43321.jpg"  />



Position, Dimension and Rotation
--------------------------------

Thinking about your shapes and how much space they need to fill within the format is very important. A circle can seem lost in space...

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/lost_in_space-0843da4c71876d87587b441f93305a2c.jpg"  />
	
... and dominant in space just by changing its placement and size.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/dominant_in_space-d55a85ac07f8c0746d06a0f0561f98c1.jpg"  />

However, it's not only the size of the shapes, but also the size of the format that matters. Here's the exact same circle that before looked to be lost in space, now dominant in relation to its format.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/dominant_format-95f463223de764c2ef3c6e4f21279870.jpg"  />

These are the options every designer must think about, weigh, and choose between. Because it changes meaning. A rectangle can lay dormant in space...

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/dormant_rect-3019809101427188e6bd29b93e3cdacb.jpg"  />
	
... and become agitated by just changing its placement

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/agitated_rect-192c91d40619567c1191d1e261fb5f87.jpg"  />
	
The important thing here is that how we place things in the format matters. We can do this all sorts of ways.

The "small" Beetle ad is a classic example of why this matters.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/beetle2-dc057d2327d7b33dcec2f68a91d7a919.jpg"  />

The same ad really wouldn't make any sense if the designer hadn't positioned and scaled the car according to the message.


Building Shapes in Processing
-----------------------------

Now that we know some basic placement techniques, how do we approach creating more complex shapes in code?

### beginShape() and endShape()

Polygons can be created in Processing using the beginShape() and endShape() methods. Some of you may already know about it, but it's important to me that you really understand the different vertex functions.

You call beginShape() when starting a new shape, then you call any of the vertex functions to create the points on the outline of a shape, and then call endShape() to close the shape.

There are three different methods for adding outline points within a shape. The assignment this week will concentrates on the use of these.

### vertex()

Points created with the vertex() function always connect to the next point in a straight line. This can be used for e.g. drawing a house.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/vertex-8685fff2c261e620156b9786a2a41f62.jpg"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/vertex)

### curveVertex()
	
Points created with the curveVertex() function will draw a curved line, guided by the point before it and after it. This means that you need a minimum of 4 points to show a single curve, as the first and last point will always be invisible. In this sketch I add 3 to the vertex loop to continue the vertex on top of points already on the line, in order to draw enough guiding points for the circle to complete.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/curvevertex-45064528217a32891ed8b972325a43da.jpg"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/curve_vertex_circle)

### bezierVertex()

The bezierVertex function is by far the most flexible of the 3 vertex functions, as it draws points using bezier curves. Most people have a faint idea of how bezier curves work, but let's take a deeper look on how to draw things with Bezier curves.

Bezier curves are essential to computational form, as it's the way most visual programming languages, as well as software tools like Photoshop and Illustrator (with the Pen tool), approach the drawing of complex polygons. It's native to the design process of everything from font design to the design of cars.

Although invented by the mathematician Paul de Casteljau, bezier curves got their name from Pierre Bézier who first used these curves in early CAD programs to design cars for Renault.

There are many different kinds of bezier curves (linear, quadratic, cubic), but we'll focus on cubic beziers, as it's the implementation of bezier curves used in Processing.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/bezier_explain-357d366aa27c09e5dea8d7981248dced.jpg"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/bezier_vertex)

A bezier curve is a formula that describes how to draw a line from one point to another, using 2 control points. The two control points determine the curve of the line going to that specific point. In Processing, you always start a shape with a simple vertex point, and then draw bezierVertex points after it.

It can be hard to understand how these two control points tell the line to curve like that. This animation shows how the curve of the line is calculated by doing simple vector math on the anchor points and control points.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/bezier_movement-efebe28a45629d49e3770bd5ff3699d1.gif"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/bezier_vertex_movement)

Here's a simple shape created with bezierVertex and vertex.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/wave-5b6fd6e9a41724a3ab83959f6b37fb4e.jpg"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/beginshape_wave)

By using bezierVertex() you can create complicated shapes in Processing. If you understand how to use it, you can now basically create any shape possible.

Here are some examples with use of more complex forms.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/bass_anatomy_murder-a051820b30f102df340ee1e18045f420.jpg"  />

Saul Bass' movie title design is widely know for their simple but very meaningful use of form. Here it's the movie poster for "Anatomy of a Murder".

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/bass_golden_arm-7d263948982070f1d3cc40a3753f5c4b.jpg"  />

Another movie poster by Saul Bass, using the same simple formula.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/strike_poster-6ae6af152b030d8ef1504f6392f28987.jpg"  />

The red shape is a very simple collection of polygon, but it still holds tremendous value in its meaning. 


Placement in Processing
-----------------------

Now that we know placement matters, let's look at how to do this in code. 

In Processing, placing things within the given format is about knowing how to use 4 key variables: x, y, width and height.

Using these variables, to place something on the screen requires basic math. This is illustrated in this example:

<img src="{% asset_path form/placement_calculations.jpg %}"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/placement_calculations)


Scaling Variables in Processing
-------------------------------

Another important thing when programming geometry is that your shapes are built from basic variables.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/cone-3f18fd648e148e1ec3fa62c12ef6177d.jpg"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/homework/icecreamcone)

The only thing we can't do yet it calculating the proximity of an object, but we'll get to that later.


Sin and Cos
-----------

The easiest way to do a generative shape with repetition is to loop many times and randomly place vertex points between the beginShape() and endShape() functions. This will look something like this:

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/beginshape_loop-04f7d1e7ac7c2caa8924605c7a0118df.jpg"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/beginshape_loop)

However, that's not super useful. Instead, we can use the sin() and cos() functions to create basic and more sophisticated shapes around a center point.

The cos() and sin() functions help us solve a simple question like this:

<blockquote >
How do I find the x and y of a point that is 300 pixels and 33 degrees away from this point?
</blockquote>

The same question is illustrated here.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/sincos-002cd808f42d8a677e1bac0d8b8687b4.jpg"  />

To do this we use the sin() and cos() functions. If you pass in a rotation and multiply it with your radius, they will return the x (cos) and y (sin) for the point we're trying to find.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/sincos_example-3bd403077a69dd18fab7ff8ef93aafb7.jpg"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/sincos_simple)

It's interesting how all the basic shapes (triangle, rectangle, hexagon, circle) can be created with cos() and sin(), just by changing the number of times the for loop runs.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/sincos_allshapes-1f06ca963b569ed464d2ad0a2ca35ad6.png"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/sincos_allshapes)

This can be used to put something on the perimeter of a circle. Now we can go back and try to do that in our placement example:

<img src="{% asset_path form/placement_calculations.jpg %}"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/placement_calculations)

We could easily make the point on the edge move by incrementing the degrees in a draw loop.

If we put this in a loop, we can generate objects with this equation. Let's look closer at how to draw a hexagon:

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/hexagon_example-e03d128b137f1b535081b2318e3cc1d7.jpg"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/sincos_hexagon)

Change a single parameter, and you get another shape:

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/hexagon2_example-413ef4476ff710658cd8b933944c0a86.jpg"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/sincos_hexagon)

Here's another sketch that rotates text around our center:

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/sincos_text-26dd2f1bb8d222aca36ea963ec1bf99e.jpg"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/sincos_text)

And another sketch that varies the radius in every loop to create a wobbly shape:

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/sincos_wobbly-b15340f3584d19ebff49c5503ddc43ce.jpg"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/sincos_wobbly)


Computational vs. Organic Form
------------------------------

When you start to look at these different shapes, you realize that some of them have inherent algorithmic characteristics. Even Michelangelo will be loose if competing with a computer in drawing a perfect circle. Changing the size of a circle in code is many times faster than doing it by hand. 

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/computational-30d4432614159cdea9f0b1f5560228df.jpg"  />

Other shapes have inherent organic qualities, and are harder to replicate on a computer. You can draw a random line across a piece of paper in less than one second, but it will take much longer to code it with beginShape(). 

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/organic-be61515c891c1ae2af6c5ebf749f175a.jpg"  />

This poses a series of questions: When working with computational form, should we prefer some shapes to other? How far should we go to simulate organic, human techniques in the digital world? Is this an argument for a new aesthetic?


Basic Repetition
----------------

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/repetitionrand1-da66e89684d33dec751badfcdd3a7468.jpg"  />

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/repetitionrand2-2973f1d9530aac3ab24c66c7a886a313.jpg"  />

Of course, plotting these vertex points by hand is much slower than just drawing them in a program like illustrator. What we really want is to be able to use a for-loop to construct our shapes.

Before we look at creating polygons in a for-loop, let's just look at how to use the for-loop with simple repetition of a circle., by recreating this Paul Rand poster.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/rand_repetition1-c04c2b404062800bb91da70afe7b02e0.jpg"  />

And here's how to recreate it in Processing.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/rand_repetition1_example-e65f2c0865d6da2c8ada3d388186dac1.jpg"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/repetition_example)

The important concept to understand here is how we use incrementing loop variables (x, y) and multiply them by the distance between the shapes.

	

Basic Randomization
-------------------

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/randomrand1-9c622b0cf38a335eb224042d238d5026.jpg"  />

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/randomrand2-5a8c9560b99932fdf06ed8d3d5ab685e.jpg"  />

Another important thing is the concept of randomness.

The basic concept of randomness is that you can let the computer choose a random number between two numbers. This seems pretty basic, but it can be used to create extremely varied outputs.

You set the constraints, the computer creates something within those constraints. It's Sol Lewitt all over again.

Let's look at some more examples and re-create them in Processing..

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/rand_random2-8aec7c35ac7aa205d975bec43e4897bd.jpg"  />

Randomness - or the idea of randomness - has been used way before the computer. Here it's more of Paul Rand's work, using random positioning and rotation. This is a simulation of pure randomness. The dots overlap and vary in their spacing.

This is very easy to create in Processing. Create 30 ellipses in a loop and give them all random position.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/rand_random2_example-e3b6773256db50a880c75bf47ebbeacb.jpg"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/random_distribution_example)

Here it's a cover for the children's book "I know a lot of things". Notice how the rectangles are randomized, but still spaced out so they never overlap. 

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/rand_random1-9154154415596c5e1ec92abfdc92b0e2.jpg"  />

The same technique can be used in code by tweaking the rectangle grid example. Before drawing each rectangle we rotate and change the position randomly from its spot in the grid. If we choose the parameters wisely, we'll never see overlapping squares.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/rand_random1_example-614acd1effaab5d1c2b616a1f24aff63.jpg"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/random_distribution_example2)


Project Examples and Code
-------------------------

Using these newly learned techniques we can look at a few advanced projects and try to re-create them in Processing.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/eno_sonnen-1bb6145d30dc6151dcae9bf0640c6de7.jpg"  />

Eno Henze is a programming artist from Germany. Here he uses random radius and stroke alpha to create a series of graphic prints.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/eno_sonnen_example-7b2593051cf4959f5e2bdd11c298610e.jpg"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/henze_sonnen_example)

The same visual can be created with Processing using the simple drawing functions, randomization and for loops.
	
<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/eno_ambushes-8e5c77b3dd93e5991bd01473796d6535.jpg"  />

Another piece by Eno Henze where he uses simple repetition and random form. This is a great example of the power of using random positioning with vertex points within beginShape().

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/henze_ambushes_example-ea4c945dc51a54991442dc5e109a37ac.jpg"  />
[Example on Github](https://github.com/runemadsen/printing-code/tree/master/form/henze_ambushes_example)

The same visual can be created with Processing and beginShape().


More Form Examples
------------------

Even with a single format and a single shape, you can create thousands of expressions to fit you communicative needs. When you really start to look, everything - even the smallest detail - is design. Choices in placement, proportions and relationships between shapes all drastically help shape the meaning of a graphic. When you look at the work of some of the best known graphic designers, you realize that they had an incredible eye for all of this. It takes talent and a lot of work to produce a graphic where you cannot put a finger on a single thing.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/rand_morse-b18dc29c7afe7e8769fbe6fbe106102f.jpg"  />

Paul Rand uses circles and rectangles to simulate morse code. The message is for executives in the radio industry, and even without noticing the morse code allegory, the shapes still have a strong way of calling attention to the graphic.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/knopf_ropes-c7173744c39b4fbf918fa947a2eca94f.jpg"  />

Alfred Knopf uses images of ropes as vertical lines to create movement and action in this book cover. The horizontal text creates a balance between the vertical and horizontal planes. Notice the symbolic crucifix shaped by the vertical and horizontal shapes.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/rand_icecream-5ceb5221a6b367e32c821241ebfc7686.jpg"  />

A circle and a triangle. The most perfect ice cream in the world.

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/rand_lollipop-a01e0e51467fdd0528d477bb34bad777.jpg"  />

10 out of 10 people would say that this is a lollipop. Why?

<img src="{{ imageproxy_url }}/rand_hat-862ba965855175f4b156ea4480a0d5b3.jpg"  />

Great use of vertical form. The line height suggests measurements, and emphasizes message about growing taller and taller.

A poster for the literary festival "Poetry on the Road", using Processing to generate a graphic print. Notice how the logo uses whitespace inside the letters to emphasize "on the road" - like a car driving through the poetry. With no arrows or anything pointing in a direction, this logo creates movement just by subtracting mass from the letters.
